One Percent for Open Source
===========================

The open source ecosystem is the most valuable part of the software industry today.
All of the companies and technologies that we build today are enabled by open source software.
From the programming languages to the web frameworks,
the operating system to the cryptography,
all of it is open source.

Open source has a `funding problem`_.
There are many `warning signs`_ that the future is not as bright as the past.

Open source is maintained for "free" by people all over the world,
enabled by the internet (which is also built on open source).
Many people doing this work are burning out,
giving up,
or just never standing in the first place.
We need to enable the sustainability of open source in order to protect this commons that we currently have,
and help it grow into the future.

Funding Open Source
-------------------

I'd like to propose an idea:

    A program called **1% for open source**: A program where Venture Capitalist's and startup companies agree to invest 1% of their funding round into the open source software that they use. 

I believe that this is a win/win/win for all involved:

* **Venture Capalists** invest in the open source ecosystem that makes companies *much cheaper to build*. It's also *really good marketing* for the VC firms, to show they are investing in the common tools we all rely on.
* **Startups** invest in the tools that they use, to *ensure continued support and maintanance*, and remove risk from their future. It will also make *hiring developers* much easier for the companies, because developers love companies that invest in open source.
* **Open source projects** are able to *fund project management and maintanance* that is required to make them sustainable for the long term. This continues the *force multiplier* that open source has given to the software industry as a whole.

Building a standard model for investing in open source,
and a point in time where we do it,
will help create more investment in our existing infrastructure.
New software projects will also be created,
because now there is a more workable sustainability model.

Why Venture Capital payments?
-----------------------------

Everyone involved in the above transaction gets values from open source.
I believe that everyone also gets value from the 1% for open source program,
through marketing and better software over time.

Having a transaction that is already happening,
with all parties benefiting,
is a natural place to redistribute some of the money that is changing hands.

How should we implement it?
---------------------------

The startup who has gotten the investment will reinvest 1% of the money from the VC firm into the open source projects that they use.

There are many different ways this could be implemented as a lower level.
A few of my ideas are:

* Startup companies create a list of the OSS projects they use, using tools like http://libraries.io/, and then give money to the 10 largest projects that are accepting money
* There could be a new non-profit foundation created, which gets all the donations, and has people on staff who manage distributing the money fairly
* You could give the money to the existing foundations that focus on the area of open source that is most valuable to you 

I think making the execution of the investment standard is an important part of making this actually happen.

Prior Art
---------

There have been a few examples of companies investing in open source in an ad hoc manner:

* `One Percent for the Planet`_ - I got the idea for a 1% investment from this wonderful non-profit.
* Stripe's `open source retreat`_ - where they fund projects to work on specific features.
* Mozilla's `open source support`_  - where they fund awards, including for projects that they specifically work on.

These are good examples,
but we need many more companies to be doing similar investment in order to make progress.
