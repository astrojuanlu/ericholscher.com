Welcome to the home of Eric Holscher on the web. 

I am the co-founder of `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ and `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_,
where I work to elevate the status of documentation in the software industry.
The main content here is my blog,
which covers various topics around documentation,
Python,
Django,
and conference organizing.

I currently live in Portland, Oregon,
and love to explore the outdoors.
Whether on bike or foot,
I spend as much time as possible out and about,
checking out the various beauty that the world holds.

Below you can find out more information about me,
and the various professional projects I'm a part of.
