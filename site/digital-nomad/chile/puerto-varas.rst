Digital Nomad Guide to Puerto Varas, Chile
==========================================

Puerto Varas is a lovely little resort town.
It has a population of around 50,000,
but the small, dense downtown has more than you'd expect for that size.
That is mostly because of tourism,
of which the high season is January & February.

There is a good internet,
a decent coworking space (lacima.cl),
and a Santander Work/Cafe (though it heavily blocks internet, including GitHub).
