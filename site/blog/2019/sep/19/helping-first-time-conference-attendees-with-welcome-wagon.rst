Helping First-Time Conference Attendees with the Welcome Wagon
==============================================================

You walk into the room and you're wearing the *wrong* thing.
Everyone else is dressed casually,
but you are not.
You feel silly and find the quickest excuse to leave the situation.
This is an example of a common situation:
not knowing what is expected of you when you enter a new place.

It's stressful to enter a new group without knowing what to expect.
It breeds anxiety and self-doubt,
and makes it much more likely you'll find excuses not to join.

At Write the Docs,
we're working to reduce the possibility of this happening.
We have a program that we call the Welcome Wagon,
that helps attendees at both the planning and the attending stage of the conference.
We hope that this makes it much easier for them to interact and get the most value out of being in our community.

Welcome Wagon Guide
-------------------

One major part of the Welcome Wagon is our `guide`_.
It is a comprehensive set of information that covers:

* Common asked questions, like "How should I dress?" and "Where is everything?"
* How to plan your time at the conference
* What is expected of you while you're at the conference
* Tips and tricks for having the best time at the event

This is basically a frequently asked questions for the conference itself.
It answers attendees most common questions *before the event*,
making it more explicit what is expected of them and how they can make sure to enjoy themselves.

Welcome Wagon Events
--------------------

The second major part of the Welcome Wagon is a set of events at the conference.
We have a couple people who are the actual humans that are the "Welcome Wagon",
and they lead the formal events at the conference.
Their picture is also in the guide to make it easy to find them at the event.

Currently we do:

* An introduction the evening before the conference
* Venue tours the evening before and morning of the conference
* We also invite the attendees to ask the Welcome Wagon team questions any time throughout the conference

These events allow us to meet with new community members in-person at the conferences.
We are able to explain to them in a different format a bit more about how to get the most out of the conference.

Run a Welcome Wagon
-------------------

If you're curious about how to run a Welcome Wagon at your conference,
you're in luck.
We have a `organizer guide`_ that explains how to do it.

We strongly believe that iteration across a number of events and perspectives are the best way to make great things.
So if you adopt a similar program at your conference we'd love to hear about it.
We are always open to feedback and ideas to make the program better as well.

You can also look at our examples from our 2019 conferences in order to get a better idea:

* `Portland 2019 Welcome Wagon`_ 
* `Prague 2019 Welcome Wagon`_

I wrote this blog post,
but the Welcome Wagon wasn't my idea.
It was created by Christy Lutz and Leona Campbell at our Portland conference.
We have been working to refine it over the years,
and I'm just hoping to promote it so other people can learn from our work.
