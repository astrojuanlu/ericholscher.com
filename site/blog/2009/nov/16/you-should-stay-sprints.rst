You should stay for the sprints
===============================

At most open source conferences, a lot of attention is given to the
talks. At the ones that I have been to (Djangocon and Pycon), the
most fun that I have had, and the most I have learned is during the
sprints. I want to talk about the value and importance of staying
for the sprints at a conference.

First off, lets talk about why you are going to the conference. I
am going to assume that you are a developer, interested in the
technology, and passionate. So the main reason that you officially
go to a conference is **to learn**. Open Source conference talks
are amazingly tech heavy, and the knowledge transferred in the
halls is vast. A speaker will give you a really great idea, insight
into a problem, and other priceless knowledge.

Then you go to another talk. You are inundated with other amazingly
new and interesting ideas. At the end of the day, your brain is
saturated, and then the dinner and the nights happen. The
unofficial reason to go to a conference is **networking**.
Networking is such a crappy term though, I view it more as
**hanging out and making friends**. I now consider lots of
ridiculously smart people friends from conference outings.

So now the conference is coming to an end, you have learned a ton,
and you have met a ton of great new people. It all seems so short,
and you're sad that you have to go home. Nope. This is
precisely the time that you want to stay and enjoy things more!
That's what Sprints are for.

Sprints allow you to solidify the friendships and knowledge that
you learned during the conference. You get to spend 2(-4) days of
working with these awesome people, on problems that you care about,
**in person**. You can take all of the knowledge that you have
gained, all the ideas that you have had, and put **pen to paper**.

The person that gave the talk that inspired your idea, when you get
stuck, is sitting across the table from you. The people that you
hung out with 3 nights ago is helping you debug
something in the Django Admin. You are helping your new 
friends conquer the concurrent turtle conundrum rife with GILs. You
are absorbing the vibrant energy that emerges from rooms full of
motivated, passionate, people **getting shit done**.

I really can't speak highly enough about the value of sprints.
There is just so much goodness and uniqueness about them. I try my
hardest to stay for them at any conference that I go to.

Do you have any awesome sprint stories? Something that I have
forgotten to mention that just blows you away? I find that sprints
aren't talked about very much, but I think they are one of my
favorite parts of being a member of an open source community.
